    - This was my first project for my data science class and it was an analysis on the rushing 
    leaders in the NFL from the years of 2019 and 2020. It utilized dplyr, kable, ggplot2, and tidyverse 
    to handle data wrangling, data tidying, and graph creating. Very interesting discoveries were made
    throughout the project, please take a look!
